                <h4> Description </h4>
                <p>
                This program is for middle school girls (5th grade-8th grade) who want to explore the different fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math. The purpose of the program is to expose girls to different subjects early in their lives. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The program will go from 9 AM - 3 PM from April 18 to April 22, during the spring break. Each day will be a different letter of STEAM (so science on Monday, technology on Tuesday, engineering on Wednesday, arts on Thursday, and math on Friday) with 3 different workshops each day. Workshops will be led by different people in the Middlebury community (professors, students, etc) and range from dance to underwater robotics to coding! At the end of the day, the girls will participate in a team building activity and a reflection. We will be hosting an babysitting time from 3 - 4 and the girls will be doing a physical activity. More information can be found on the website, bit.ly/middsteam, it is currently under construction but will be updated over time!
                </p>
                <p>
                Scholarships are available through Middlebury Parks & Recreation.

                <h2>Why STEM matters</h2>
                <p>
                    In middle school, 74% of girls express interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM), but when choosing a college major, just 0.4% of high school girls select computer science. There's a huge gender gap in STEAM fields, but we want to change that! This program will allow girls to be exposed to the various fields. 
                </p>

                <p>MJ, a Middlebury college freshman and co-founder of MIDDSTEAM, has been doing computer science outreach for almost 3 years and Terri, director of Middlebury's Town Rec Center and co-founder, has been in the recreation business for over 20 years! We selectively chose workshop leaders based on their interest and passion for different topics!
