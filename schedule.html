                <h2> Monday </h2>
                
                <b><h4> Meet the STEAM Team!! </h4> Hannah Benz (STEM advisor at the CCI) </b>
                <p> 
                    12 female Middlebury STEAM majors will participate in a panel discussion. We'll learn how each panel member became interested in Biology/Chemistry/Engineering/Physics/Arts/Math/Psychology, etc and the campers will learn a little bit about each student's path. How did she select a major? What has she loved about her field and what are the challenges? We'll learn about valuable internships the students have done, and what they are thinking about doing in the future. We'll learn about what they wish they had known back in Middle School and what good STEAM advice they they have received along the way they might wish to share. 
                </p>

                <b><h4> Jewelry Making </h4> Meredith Robertson ('19) </b>
                <p> 
                    Beading 101 with Meredith Robertson. All participants will be able to make a necklace, bracelet, keychain, or pair of earrings.

                <p>
                    Like Marilyn Monroe said, "It is better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring." In this workshop we will play fun group games, allowing our inner goofballs to shine! As another very famous Charlie Chaplin said, "A day without laughter is a day wasted." We will be absolutely ridiculous and will not waste a second on the boring! So...come Laugh with us!

                <b><h4> Math Bingo </h4>
                Kate Monroe ('18.5) & Monica Chow ('16) </b>
                <p>
                B-I-N-G-O and Bingo Was Her Name-O. There were some math lovers who had some numbers and Kate and Monica were their name-o's! Calling all other number lovers to attention! Come use what you know about the mathematical principals of this universe, ranging from addition and subtraction to basic geometry, in some magical games of mathematical bingo! There will be prizes for our best and brightest math lovers out there!

                <h2> Friday </h2>
                <b><h4> Saving Physics-verse</h4>
                Kate Monroe ('18.5) & Emma Moskovitz ('18) </b>
                <p>
                Come on an adventure and help us save Physics-verse! The central power source of Physics-verse has been destroyed by evil Dr. Entropy, and it’s up to us to put it back together. Collect the pieces of the power source by completing different tasks and expanding your knowledge of the physical phenomena that surround us in our everyday lives. Experience the power of heat and pressure to crush the wall of defense that prevents us from reaching Dr. Entropy’s lair. Strike the perfect note, while learning about wave motion and resonance, to unlock the door. Once inside the lair, we will have all of the pieces of the power source, and the energy needed to fuel it. All that’s left is to balance the forces acting on a swinging bucket of water in order to prevent the loss of the precious fuel that the power source needs to work again. Once we have done that, we will complete our final task harnessing all of the power of physics, and energy will be restored to Physics-verse. We need your help STEAMers! Be there and help us defeat Dr. Entropy before our universe spirals into complete and utter disorder!
